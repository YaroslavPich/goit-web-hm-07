## Description

This repository contains a project that implements a database for students, teachers, groups, and subjects. The database also includes students' grades with the dates when they were received. The data was randomly generated using the Faker library.

## SQL Queries

In the `select/` directory, you'll find SQL queries for various selections from the database. Each file corresponds to a specific task:

- **`query_1.sql`** - Top 5 students with the highest average grade across all subjects.
- **`query_2.sql`** - The student with the highest average grade in a specific subject.
- **`query_3.sql`** - Average grade in groups for a specific subject.
- **`query_4.sql`** - Average grade across all grades in the database (overall flow).
- **`query_5.sql`** - Courses taught by a specific teacher.
- **`query_6.sql`** - List of students in a specific group.
- **`query_7.sql`** - Grades of students in a specific group for a specific subject.
- **`query_8.sql`** - The average grade given by a specific teacher across their subjects.
- **`query_9.sql`** - List of courses attended by a specific student.
- **`query_10.sql`** - List of courses taught to a specific student by a specific teacher.
- **`query_11.sql`** - The average grade a specific teacher gives to a specific student (additional query).
- **`query_12.sql`** - Grades of students in a specific group for a specific subject on the last lesson (additional query).
